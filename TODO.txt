To do list:

Next enemy: smashing enemy - brute

[1:01:38 AM] Korea: these enemies SHOULD
[1:01:42 AM] Korea: spawn off screen
[1:01:45 AM] Korea: run in
[1:02:00 AM] Korea: and then they'd run up to the player, but stop some distance away
[1:02:22 AM] Korea: they'd strafe back and forth for a short bit
[1:02:25 AM] Korea: and then run up for a blow
[1:02:58 AM] Korea: that would be the MOST basic way they'd act
[1:03:29 AM] Korea: and then from there we can add if they should block, or if they'll so some other kind of attack, etc.
